#Intro
An example of Redis clone where user can upvote and downvote a post. 
A registered user can interact with each post and view details of the post and the user who posted it.
Through Redis, cookie session is stored and used once user is logged in. A user can decide to delete the cookie also remembers it.

### Techs
* Typescript
* Node
* Graphql
* Postgres
* NextJS
* Others...

This simple app is not practical behind the hood, its
a hard to get used to it and you'll probably encounter bugs along the way.
This might not be a perfect fullstack app built purely in JS but I had a lot of fun.

Thank you :)
